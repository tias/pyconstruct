**Pyconstruct** is a Python library for declarative, constrained,
structured-output prediction. When using Pyconstruct, the problem specification
can be encoded in MiniZinc, a high-level constraint programming language. This
means that domain knowledge can be declaratively included in the inference
procedure as constraints over the optimization variables.

Sounds complicated? Check out the [Quick Start
guide](https://unitn-sml.github.io/pyconstruct/quick_start.html) for to learn
how to solve your first problem with Pyconstruct.

Have a look at the [docs](https://unitn-sml.github.io/pyconstruct/index.html)
and the [reference
manual](https://unitn-sml.github.io/pyconstruct/reference/index.html) too, to
learn more about it!

Install
-------
Pyconstruct can be installed through `pip`:

```bash
pip install pyconstruct
```

Or by downloading the code from Github and running the following from the
downloaded directory:

```bash
python setup.py install
```

After installing Pyconstruct you will need to install **MiniZinc** as well.
Download the latest release of MiniZincIDE and follow the instructions.

Check out the [Installation
guide](https://unitn-sml.github.io/pyconstruct/install.html) for more details.
