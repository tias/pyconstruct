Install
=======

Weaver can be installed via Pip::

    pip install pyconstruct

or from the source code available
on `GitHub <https://github.com/unitn-sml/pyconstruct/releases/latest>`__::

    python setup.py install

Currently, Pyconstruct is developed and maintained in Python 3.5 with a
porting to Python 2.7 at every major release (the python2 branch does not always
contain the most recent changes).

Pyconstruct requires PyMzn to be installed on your machine, together with
MiniZinc and at least one solver (e.g. `Gecode <http://www.gecode.org/>`__,
`Gurobi <http://www.gurobi.com/>`__). Check-out `PyMzn installation guide
<http://paolodragone.com/pymzn/install.html>`__ for details.
