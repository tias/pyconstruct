Pyconstruct is a Python library for declarative, constrained, structured-output
prediction. When using Pyconstruct, the problem specification can be encoded in
MiniZinc, a high-level constraint programming language. This means that domain
knowledge can be declaratively included in the inference procedure as
constraints over the optimization variables.
